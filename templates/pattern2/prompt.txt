You are a thumbnail editor. Make minimal, precise edits to Image 1 (base template).

RULES: Do NOT change background, gold glitter, SnsClub logo, マネタイズ講座 title, white box shape, gray diagonal-striped bottom bar, GUEST/GENRE label badges, overall layout and dimensions.

CRITICAL PHONE POSITIONING: The bottom 45% of the smartphone extends beyond the image boundary. Only the top 55% of the phone is visible - the feed grid is almost entirely cut off, showing mainly the profile header and bio section. The phone should appear to sink deeply into the bottom edge of the image.

CHANGES:
1. TEXT ONLY (same font style/size/color/position):
   - White box text → 「{サムネ文言}」
   - GUEST line → 「{講師名}」
   - GENRE line → 「{ジャンル}」

2. PHONE SCREEN: Replace only the phone screen content with the screen from Image 2. Keep the phone frame, tilt angle, and size exactly as-is.

Output single 16:9 image.
